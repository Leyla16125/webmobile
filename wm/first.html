    <h1>Antoine Bosselut</h1>
    <p>Assistant Professor</p>

    <br><br><br>

    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>I am an assistant professor in the School of Computer and Communication Sciences at EPFL. I lead the EPFL NLP group where we conduct research on natural language processing (NLP) systems that can model, represent, and reason about human and world knowledge.

        Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in the SNAP and NLP groups working with Jure Leskovec and Chris Manning. I completed a PhD in CS at the University of Washington, where I worked with Yejin Choi, and a BEng in EE at McGill University.
        
        </p>

    <strong>I will be taking on new PhD students this year (and next year).</strong>
